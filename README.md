First Three Sections:

In the first three sections, I downloaded the mingw compiler, set it in my PATH variables, set up a new IDE I have not used before (CodeLite), and configured the compiler. I also added the first workspace within CodeLite and established a user template to use for new projects. Lastly, I used Notepad to write a cpp program and compiled it using the command line.
