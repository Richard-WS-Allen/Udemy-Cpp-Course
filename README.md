# Udemy-Cpp-Course
A repo consisting of projects developed throughout the Udemy Beginning C++ Programming From Beginner to Beyond course.
Using as a refresher of beginning topics and diving deeper into programming with C++ before I move on to more challenging topics.

First Three Sections:

In the first three sections, I downloaded the mingw compiler, set it in my PATH variables, set up a new IDE I have not used before (CodeLite), and configured the compiler. I also added the first workspace within CodeLite and established a user template to use for new projects. Lastly, I used Notepad to write a cpp program and compiled it using the command line.

Section Four:

In this section, we were to write another simple program. This time to prompt the user for their favorite number and print:
"Amazing! That's my favorite number too!"
"No really, *user number* is my favorite number!:

Section Five:

Section five was just an overview of the structure of C++ programs including: how the compiler sees comments, preprocessor directives, the main() function, namespaces, and basic I/O.

Section Six:

Section six went over constants and other variables. This included using sizeof to see bytes used by different types and min and max, to see the minimum and maximum values of some of the basic types. I found it interesting on my Windows machine the sizeof, min, and max were the same for int and long. However, on my Linux machine, long and long long were the same. There was also a challenge to make a carpet cleaning service calculator using user input (number of small and large rooms) and output of price (subtotal and total with tax). I also took some time to do the setup steps for my new Linux machine before continuing to the next sections.
